# Goal
Model elevator problem in order to store proper data to create machine learning models.

# What are we optimizing for in a basic model?
- get the optimized resting floor?
- (time?, cost?)

# Tasks
- [ ] Model the problem into a storage schema (SQL DB schema or whatever you prefer)
- [ ] CRUD some data

- [ ] Have the data in a suitable format to feed to a prediction training algorithm


### Marking
